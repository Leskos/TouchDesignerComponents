# TouchDesignerComponents
Collection of .tox components

## TimeMachine
Simple wrapper for doing slit scan effects with the TimeMachine TOP.

## AutoPresetUI
Reworked version of Keith Lostracco's great little preset UI component that auto populates based on a page of custom parameters. Slightly bodgy, but currently supports int, float, toggle and menu parameters.

Instructions:
- Point the Targetop parameter at whichever op you want presets for.
- Select which page of parameters to use
- Right click preset buttons to store preset
- Left click preset buttons to recall preset
- Right click title bar to edit preset names
